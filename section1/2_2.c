/*
    Before we jump into the syntax for declaring variables its important to understand what varibales are. Variables can be best imagined 
    as some sort of containers where we can store resources (data and definitions) required within our code. Just like containers variables 
    have labels which gives us an idea about what are we storing. So it is adviced to use labels (variable names) which are not ambiguous. 
    In addition to the labels we also need to know what excatly is it that we are storing. Everything stored in memory with certain type we
    refer to them as datatypes and each datatype is assigned necessary memory depending on its expected size. So as we can see it is 
    very important to have good label and know what we will be storing to make sure that our programs are easily understood and work efficiently.
